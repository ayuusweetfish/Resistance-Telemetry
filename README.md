# Resistance Telemetry

*ðŸš§ Feature complete. Docs to be polished.*

A compact sensor for a variable resistance that transmits data through BLE. A client program provides an interface for plotting and inspecting values on a desktop computer.

The device is physically compact (3.3 cm Ã— 1.7 cm, around the size of the battery cell plus the antenna). It is powered by a LIR2016 cell and requires no setup on the computer side. Resolution is 24-bit, but no extensive calibration has currently been carried out. Designed for laboratory use, e.g. for e-skin gloves user studies.
